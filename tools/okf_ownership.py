"""The OKF has one writer and everyone reads it, with the pen handed over during a call.

HIS DIRECTIVE, 2026-10-03, relayed by Grok as GROK-OKF-LIVE-WRITE-20261003T1426Z: "Claude (tag
claude-code-cli) must have write access to the OKF for three projects: the conference line,
sfdc24.com, and Blackboard ... Everyone else gets read access. If another agent needs to write
during the conference, create the rule that hands over the microphone and the pen." He had said the
same thing on the 10:03 call: "The conference is a live working session, not a discussion that waits
for execution after the meetings."

The conference line got this rule first (its `tools/check_ownership.py`, PRs 161 and 162) and
Blackboard second (`scripts/okf_ownership.py`, PR 319). This is the same rule for sfdc24.com - the
third repository his directive names, and the one that had no OKF at all - and it is DELIBERATELY
NARROW:

  * it has an opinion about `docs/okf/` and about nothing else. The site has no package ownership
    map and this is not the place to invent one, so every path outside the OKF passes - the pages,
    the assets, the tools and the tests are judged by the suites that already guard them;
  * `claude-code-cli` and `pi1-cli` both write the OKF's pages (his words of 19:45Z added the Pi);
    the floor file stays with the operator of the calls alone;
  * `docs/okf/gemini/` is NOT a standing exception, and on this repository there was never a
    folder there to be one. Codex's security review of Blackboard #304 (5e2a4cb) ruled that no
    free model text from the board goes to a PUBLIC repository, and this site is the most public
    of the three; `scripts/okf_land.py` lands Gemini's signed RESULTs in the private conference
    repository alone. The rule granted `gemini/*` unconditional write to that path here anyway -
    the same line of code as Codex's second P1 on the Blackboard twin (2ec9ee0) - and it is gone.
    Gemini is handed an OKF page by a floor grant like anyone else, which is the reviewed path;
  * a handover is read from the PROTECTED BASE (`--base`), never from the branch being checked. The
    conference's first version read the candidate's own copy of the floor file, so a branch could
    add its own grant line and be admitted by it (Codex's P1 on conference #161). Here that mistake
    is closed before it can be made;
  * `docs/okf/floor.md` is NON-DELEGABLE. No grant reaches the page that hands out the pen;
  * two grants on one page refuse the whole run and name the pair to strike;
  * a grant belongs to ONE call. The site has no call plan of its own, so the floor file's own
    front matter carries the `call:` the open grants belong to, and a grant naming any other call is
    not in force. The operator changes that one line when a new call opens, which retires every
    older grant in a single edit. No clock, no job, no expiry claim.

No base, no floor on the base, or no call in the floor's front matter means NO GRANT IS IN FORCE,
and the check says which of those it was rather than quietly refusing.

AND THE GRANT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS WHAT THE RULE CAN SEE. Codex's exact-head review of c33cf11
(2026-10-03 20:26Z, CODEX-OKF-GUARD-RESULT) got past the version above six ways, each closed here:

  * the authority is the PROTECTED BRANCH, named as such (`--protected`, or a `--base` that names
    it), and never the base a pull request chose for itself;
  * the floor's front matter must name EXACTLY ONE call; two is ambiguous and puts nothing in force;
  * what changed is git's own account (`changed()`), `-z` with `-M -C`, so a rename names both of
    its ends and no path comes back C-quoted;
  * a path handed in quoted is unquoted before it is judged, and git's output is read as UTF-8
    rather than this box's code page;
  * a branch may not PROPOSE two pens on one page, and a protected floor already in that state
    refuses every run but one: the operator's repair of that page, alone in its pull request;
  * the rule answers its own controls before it judges anything (`controls_hold`).

AND CODEX GOT PAST THAT THREE MORE WAYS (00:25Z, on c33cf11 and conference a4abec9):

  * the short name was shadowable - `git show origin/main:f` prefers `refs/heads/origin/main`, and
    anyone may push a branch by that name - so every short name now resolves through `FULL`;
  * the decision to USE the trusted copy was the candidate's, since the step that extracts it lives
    in the candidate's workflow, so the rule proves which copy it is (`trusted_copy`) and honours no
    grant while it is not the protected branch's own;
  * a collision is judged within one call (`overlapping_in_a_call`), because a grant retired with an
    older call was blocking a valid new one;
  * and every `call:` KEY counts, not every non-empty value.

AND THEN THE ONE THAT COULD NOT BE CLOSED IN THIS FILE AT ALL (Codex's P1 on 2ec9ee0 and on
conference 133529f, the third review running: "independent enforcement remains absent...
Self-comparison cannot establish independent authority"). Two holes, both structural:

  * a `pull_request` workflow's own definition comes from the candidate's merge ref, so the branch
    being judged could replace the enforcement step with a no-op, or delete the job;
  * everything above was read with `git show <ref>:<path>` against a LOCAL remote-tracking ref,
    and candidate code - run by an earlier step of that same candidate workflow, `python
    tests/test_okf_ownership.py` out of the candidate's tree - could repoint it at a commit of
    own choosing carrying an unmodified rule and a fabricated grant. `trusted_copy()` then compared
    two things the same contamination reached and agreed with the fabrication. No amount of
    hashing fixes that: a hash of a contaminated ref is a hash of a contaminated ref.

So provenance stopped being claimed from inside this file. THE GATE IS
`.github/workflows/okf-ownership-trusted.yml`, a `pull_request_target` workflow - the one
pull-request trigger whose definition GitHub takes from the BASE BRANCH - which checks out the
forge-named base commit, never the candidate's, runs no candidate code at all, and hands this rule:

    --trusted-base <base sha>      and `trusted_posture()` REFUSES unless `git rev-parse HEAD` IS
                                   that sha, so the posture cannot be claimed from a command line
    --base-ref <branch>            which must name the protected branch, or no grant counts: a
                                   pull request may target an unmerged branch of its own
    --changed-from <file>          the forge's own `pulls/<n>/files`, both ends of every rename,
                                   instead of a local diff against a ref that could be moved
    --candidate-floor <file>       the branch's own floor.md, fetched as DATA and read ONLY to
                                   refuse two pens on one page. Never checked out, never executed

There is NO FALLBACK. A missing changed-path list, a checkout that is not the base commit, or a
base that is not the protected branch all refuse. Run without `--trusted-base` - which is what
`okf-ownership.yml` and a person at a terminal do - the rule prints `ADVISORY ... this run is not
the gate and decides nothing`, and `trusted_copy()` still withholds every grant.

AND THEN FOUR MORE, ON THE GATE ITSELF (Codex on a1e1e4f and conference 2496937):

  * A PATH IS BYTES. `paths_from()` read one path per line and stripped each one, which is lossy:
    a leading or trailing space is a valid path byte, so the unowned `" docs/okf/index.md"`
    arrived as the owned `"docs/okf/index.md"` and changed the answer. The forge's list is a JSON
    array now and nothing is transformed at all.
  * AN AUTHORITY FILE MUST BE A REGULAR BLOB. Reading the floor from the working tree followed
    symlinks, which is a bypass with no edit to the protected path: point `docs/okf/floor.md` at
    an ordinary file elsewhere ONCE, and every later edit to that target hands out the pen while
    the non-delegable path looks untouched. `authority_at()` reads it through the commit's own
    tree entry and refuses mode `120000`, or anything that is not a blob - so a checkout that
    materialises symlinks as text cannot disguise one either.
  * THE CANDIDATE FLOOR FAILS CLOSED. The workflow turned every fetch failure into an empty
    floor - a 403, a 500, a `type: symlink`, and the documented case where the contents API omits
    base64 content for a blob over 1 MiB - and an empty floor proposes nothing, so each of those
    silently skipped the proposed-overlap refusal. Only a confirmed 404 means absence now; only a
    `file` with base64 content whose decoded length matches the declared size is read; anything
    else fails the gate.
  * THE FILES THAT DECIDE ARE THE OPERATOR'S. Everything outside `docs/okf/` passes this rule by
    design, and that included this rule, its suite and BOTH workflow definitions - so any branch
    could weaken the gate while keeping the expected check name, and later pull requests would
    pass a toothless check. `AUTHORITY` is refused to every prefix but the operator's, and no
    grant reaches it however wide.

AND WHAT THE REPOSITORY STILL HAS TO SAY, which no file here can. On the Blackboard twin, measured 2026-10-04, `main`'s protection
required exactly one context with `strict: false` and zero approvals; this repository's own
setting is his to read and to change. So a stale green tick can still be merged, and this gate is not yet a merge barrier at
all. The gate refuses a base that is not the protected branch's current tip, which is strict-base
enforced from the inside; making it binding needs `okf-ownership / the gate` added as a required
context AND "require branches to be up to date", and both are the repository owner's settings.

WHAT NONE OF IT SETTLES: a branch prefix is attribution, not an authenticated identity. The whole
fleet pushes as one GitHub account, so this rule says which paths a prefix may write and not who
holds it. That needs a GitHub App per agent, which is a build and his word.

A branch prefix is attribution, not an authenticated identity: everyone pushes as the same account.
That is as true here as it is on the conference line, and a grant trusts the prefix the same way.

    `pull_request` workflow's own definition comes from the candidate's merge ref, so the candidate

    provenance".

    So provenance is no longer claimed from inside. It is established by WHERE the run happens:
    `.github/workflows/okf-ownership-trusted.yml` is a `pull_request_target` workflow, whose

    out the forge-named base commit and never the candidate's. No candidate code runs in it at all,
    so there is no earlier step left to contaminate anything.

    What this function does is check that story against the checkout: the commit the rule runs out
    of must BE the base commit the forge named. A candidate tree, a merge ref or a reanchored ref
