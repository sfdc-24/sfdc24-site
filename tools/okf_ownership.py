"""The OKF has one writer and everyone reads it, with the pen handed over during a call.

HIS DIRECTIVE, 2026-10-03, relayed by Grok as GROK-OKF-LIVE-WRITE-20261003T1426Z: "Claude (tag
claude-code-cli) must have write access to the OKF for three projects: the conference line,
sfdc24.com, and Blackboard ... Everyone else gets read access. If another agent needs to write
during the conference, create the rule that hands over the microphone and the pen." He had said the
same thing on the 10:03 call: "The conference is a live working session, not a discussion that waits
for execution after the meetings."

The conference line got this rule first (its `tools/check_ownership.py`, PRs 161 and 162) and
Blackboard second (`scripts/okf_ownership.py`, PR 319). This is the same rule for sfdc24.com - the
third repository his directive names, and the one that had no OKF at all - and it is DELIBERATELY
NARROW:

  * it has an opinion about `docs/okf/` and about nothing else. The site has no package ownership
    map and this is not the place to invent one, so every path outside the OKF passes - the pages,
    the assets, the tools and the tests are judged by the suites that already guard them;
  * `claude-code-cli` and `pi1-cli` both write the OKF's pages (his words of 19:45Z added the Pi);
    the floor file stays with the operator of the calls alone;
  * `docs/okf/gemini/` stays Gemini's own corner here too, so a signed RESULT has somewhere to
    land that is not the shared pack;
  * a handover is read from the PROTECTED BASE (`--base`), never from the branch being checked. The
    conference's first version read the candidate's own copy of the floor file, so a branch could
    add its own grant line and be admitted by it (Codex's P1 on conference #161). Here that mistake
    is closed before it can be made;
  * `docs/okf/floor.md` is NON-DELEGABLE. No grant reaches the page that hands out the pen;
  * two grants on one page refuse the whole run and name the pair to strike;
  * a grant belongs to ONE call. The site has no call plan of its own, so the floor file's own
    front matter carries the `call:` the open grants belong to, and a grant naming any other call is
    not in force. The operator changes that one line when a new call opens, which retires every
    older grant in a single edit. No clock, no job, no expiry claim.

No base, no floor on the base, or no call in the floor's front matter means NO GRANT IS IN FORCE,
and the check says which of those it was rather than quietly refusing.

AND THE GRANT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS WHAT THE RULE CAN SEE. Codex's exact-head review of c33cf11
(2026-10-03 20:26Z, CODEX-OKF-GUARD-RESULT) got past the version above six ways, each closed here:

  * the authority is the PROTECTED BRANCH, named as such (`--protected`, or a `--base` that names
    it), and never the base a pull request chose for itself;
  * the floor's front matter must name EXACTLY ONE call; two is ambiguous and puts nothing in force;
  * what changed is git's own account (`changed()`), `-z` with `-M -C`, so a rename names both of
    its ends and no path comes back C-quoted;
  * a path handed in quoted is unquoted before it is judged, and git's output is read as UTF-8
    rather than this box's code page;
  * a branch may not PROPOSE two pens on one page, and a protected floor already in that state
    refuses every run but one: the operator's repair of that page, alone in its pull request;
  * the rule answers its own controls before it judges anything (`controls_hold`), and CI runs the
    copy from the protected branch, outside the checkout, because the branch being judged was
    supplying its own judge.

A branch prefix is attribution, not an authenticated identity: everyone pushes as the same account.
That is as true here as it is on the conference line, and a grant trusts the prefix the same way.
