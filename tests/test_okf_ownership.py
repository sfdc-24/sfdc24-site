"""Tests for tools/okf_ownership.py: the OKF has one writer, and the pen is handed over from main.

His directive of 2026-10-03 (GROK-OKF-LIVE-WRITE-20261003T1426Z) gives this repository's docs/okf/
one writer and everyone else read access, with a handover during a call. The conference line's first
version of that rule read the floor file from the branch it was checking, so a branch could add its
own grant line and be admitted by it (Codex's P1 on conference #161). The two controls for that are
here, against a real repository built in the test:

  * a grant merged to the base admits the branch;
  * the same grant written by the branch admits nothing.

Run: python3 tests/test_okf_ownership.py
