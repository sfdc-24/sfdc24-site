"""Tests for tools/okf_ownership.py: the OKF has one writer, and the pen is handed over from main.

His directive of 2026-10-03 (GROK-OKF-LIVE-WRITE-20261003T1426Z) gives this repository's docs/okf/
one writer and everyone else read access, with a handover during a call. The conference line's first
version of that rule read the floor file from the branch it was checking, so a branch could add its
own grant line and be admitted by it (Codex's P1 on conference #161). The two controls for that are
here, against a real repository built in the test:

  * a grant merged to the base admits the branch;
  * the same grant written by the branch admits nothing.

Run: python3 tests/test_okf_ownership.py

# ================= THE GATE: the posture it demands, and everything it refuses without ========
#
# Codex's P1, three reviews running: "independent enforcement remains absent... Self-comparison
# cannot establish independent authority." Two structural holes, neither closable in Python from
# inside a candidate-defined workflow: a `pull_request` workflow's definition comes from the
# candidate's merge ref, so the enforcement step can be replaced; and everything the rule read
# came through `git show <local ref>:<path>`, which candidate code run by an earlier step of that
# same workflow could repoint.
#
# The answer is not a cleverer comparison. It is WHERE the run happens:
# .github/workflows/okf-ownership-trusted.yml is a `pull_request_target` workflow, whose
# definition GitHub takes from the base branch, which checks out the forge-named base commit and
# never the candidate's, and which takes the changed set from the forge's own pulls/<n>/files.
# What the rule can check from inside is that this story is true of the tree it is running in -
# and that is what these controls are about. There is no fallback anywhere in it.

# THE REANCHORING, EXECUTED. This is the mechanism Codex said remained unclosed across three
# reviews: candidate code repoints the local remote-tracking ref at a commit of its own carrying an
# otherwise unmodified rule and a FABRICATED GRANT, and every read the rule made through
# `git show refs/remotes/origin/main:<path>` then agreed with the fabrication. Here the base commit
# carries no grant at all, refs/remotes/origin/main carries one, and the checkout is the base. The
# gate must read the tree it is standing in.
#
# It is also the control that was missing. A racing pair of mutation runs left the gate reading
# `_show("origin/main", FLOOR)` in place of `worktree_floor()` and the suite still passed 82 of 82,
# because every other fixture has HEAD and refs/remotes/origin/main at the same commit, so nothing
# could tell the two reads apart.
